These are the configuration files that should be used in lab 2 of
TNM086. All except ..single.xml set up two cluster nodes and thus need
two instances running simultaneously.

Use the configuration file linux_lab_VRPN_tracking.xml to connect to
trackers also in the Linux lab. It will connect to simulated tracking
provided by a H3D program started with the following command:

H3DLoad urn:candy:x3d/VRPNServer.x3d
